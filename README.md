# todo-list

## About the Project

This project contains a very simple todo list application that allows for the addition and removal of tasks. Its intended purpose is for the understanding of the creation of a sub-domain GitHub page, and to implement some rudimentary HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Possibility for extension.

The app is live on my GitHub page [here](https://anthonybane.github.io/todo-list/).
